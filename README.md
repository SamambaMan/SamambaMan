### Hi there, I'm Felipe Ferreira! 👋


I'm a Data Engineer, Sr. Python developer and Data Team Leader, based in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil!

- 🔭 I’m currently working at @MinisterioPublicoRJ as Data Engineering Team Leader
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Statistics, Machine Learning and Hadoop based technologies
- 💬 Ask me about Big Data, Python, cycling, archery and pc-master-race (the last is a serious one)
- 📫 Reach me asap: felipe.gomes.ferreira@gmail.com or, preferably, <a href="https://t.me/SamambaMan">Telegram</a>
- 😄 Pronouns: Samamba, Plantinha
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with my LinkedIn Profile! This needs some improvement
- ⚡ Fun fact: Samamba derives from "Samambaia", a plant in the group of pteridophytes. A nickname I've received in college due to my hair format when it's long 😂
